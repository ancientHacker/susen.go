      <p>Sorry, but an unexpected error occurred while the server was processing your request.  The English description of the error is:</p>
      <blockquote><em>{{.Message}}</em></blockquote>
      <p>It is possible this error was due to a temporary condition, and will not occur again.  If you would like to retry your original request, simply refresh this page.  If you end up here a <em>second</em> time, try resetting your current puzzle (losing all your work so far) by clicking <a href="/reset/">here</a> instead.  If you end up here a <em>third</em> time, try resetting your entire session by clicking <a href="/reset/default">here</a> (which will put you back on the home page with no puzzle history).</p>
      <p>If you are willing to take the time to report this error, the developers will be very grateful.  To do so, just <a href="{{.ReportBugPage}}">click here</a> to open a new window, describe the circumstances in which the error occurred, and include following build info in your report: {{.ApplicationFooter}}.  Thanks in advance for doing so!</p>
