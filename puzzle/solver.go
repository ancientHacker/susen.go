Sudoku puzzle solver

The solver uses an algorithm adapted from the method used by some
human solvers I have observed.  It is a depth-first search
algorithm that uses a stack for backtracking.  It is called
Ariadne's thread, after the mythical heroine who used a ball of
yarn as a stack in her depth-first search for an exit from the
minotaur's maze.

1. Fill in all the bound values you can.

2. Check the state of the puzzle:

2.1 If the puzzle is solved, you're done.

2.2 If the puzzle has errors, go to step 4.

2.3 The puzzle has unbound, empty squares.  Continue to step 3.

3. Guess a value for an unbound, empty square as follows:

3.1 Find the first unbound square with the fewest number of
possible values.  (Any order for choosing the square works, this
algorithm uses reading order.)

3.2 Save the puzzle state, the chosen square, and the possible
values on the top of the stack.

3.3 Assign the first of the possible values to the chosen square.

3.4 Go to step 1.

4. "Rewind your thread" as follows:

4.1 Pop the stack until you find an entry that has unused choices
for its chosen square.

4.2 If the stack is empty, stop.  The puzzle can't be solved.

4.3 Restore the puzzle state from the state on the stack.

4.4 Fill in the chosen square with the first remaining possible value.

4.5 Go to step 1.

This algorithm yields a sequence of assignments to unbound
squares, in the order they are tried in step 3.2.  These are
stored as entries on the stack, and can be examined upon return
from step 2.

Many Sudoku puzzles found in publications actually have multiple
solutions.  This algorithm can be easily adapted to find all such
solutions by changing step 2 to save the solution and jump to
step 4.
